And I'm going to share my screen. All right. So to start with, I just sent you a link to this Google Map. That is the property we are talking about, which is the Club Med in Marrakech. This is the outdoor bar. Okay. This is the theme where they are doing shows in the evening. All right. So we're going to have to build our cabin somewhere there. Okay. So if you go to the link I sent you for that, you really, really see the context. And you can walk through the overall Marrakech property. You see La Palmar√© here. Okay. So you can take a look at it whenever you want. Okay. So if we start on the presentation of the project itself. Okay. All right. So it's a very straightforward project. It's very small. Basically, we are doing a nine square meter small building to host the sound and light that is used for when they do the shows in the evening. Okay. So it's quite straightforward. This is a picture of the Club Med. One of the picture of the Club Med. So what is Club Med? Club Med is a French hotelier. It's an all-in-one resort. So usually people come with family. It's really family and friends. It's all generation mixed. Okay. And they usually resort kind of hotels. And they try to fit within their surroundings. So they try to match the architecture and the style of the buildings around. Okay. So this is the property. You can see the entire development here. It's quite huge. And it's next to olive trees. They build olive trees and they have a lot of pine trees. So these are pictures of the property itself. Okay. And you can see that it's built the same as what we call a riad. If you're familiar with the term, American riad. So here for you, I put a few attributes of the architecture of a riad. The top pictures are pictures from the Club Med itself. So you can see that they are using the arcs. They are using the type of finishes, terracotta finishes. They are using the round circle but some other areas. Not everything is rounded. You have some normal windows and doors. This is an example of a rooftop of a riad. Because usually it's a flat roof and they use the top as a terrace. And this is a typical riad. So I put for you here some of the elements like stucco plaster, for example. I mean anything, clay bricks, stucco plaster. Because they really want us to work on a design that will match the rest and blend the rest of the environment. All right. This is a big property. And the space we are going to look at is somewhere around here. You can see the round shape here. Which is the scene that we saw earlier. The stage that we saw earlier. And it's surrounded with sandalwood. So if I do a zoom on it. And that you will have in the DWG file, in the AutoCAD file. This is the space we are. So this is the stage again. And we have to be a little bit away from the stage. So somewhere here. It's not extremely precise where you're going to have to be. So for you, you will implement your building somewhere around here. And the client can define exactly where it's going to be. But it's just to put a context. And for you, when you draw your perspective. To show how is it going to blend with the environment of the space here. Let me know, Armand, if you have any questions along the way. Or else you can always ask me a question at the end. It doesn't matter. Okay. So same as the Google Earth that you have. You can see the bar here. So a half round circle around the building. Which is here. Okay. This is the view if I'm looking towards that side. Okay. You can see the building here. And this is the view from the other side. If I'm looking at the semi-round. What they call rotund. Around here, the day beds. But I think when you look at the Google Earth. It's really straightforward. These are the Sunday beds. I'm talking about. This is the stage. Peak stage. And this is the view from the bar area. So if I'm standing at the bar area. And I turn myself. I will look at the stage here. And you can see the round Sunday beds all around here. Okay. Next. So our building. The one we need to do. Is about a 3 by 3 meter. This is the footprint that they give us. So not more than that. And the height. They say approximately 2.2 meter. But it's up to you. It can be slightly. It can be 2.4. I don't think it will be a big deal. The position needs to be looking towards the scene. So because they do the sound and light system. So they have to see what's happening on the scene itself. In order to project the right lighting at the right time. And the right music at the right time. Okay. So you will see the front. In front. The facade. So the one facing the stage. Will have to be sliding windows. And has to be looking over the scene. Okay. This one will stay here. Because that's the sound system. Obviously. And then on the side. You can always have glass sliding doors. Looking towards the golf. The golf is on the other side. The golf is here. So they will walk from here. They will have natural light. Looking from here. And then they will have the windows coming from here. They are quite specific in wanting the floor to be finished with tiles. So you can pick whatever tiles you want. The selection of the goods you're going to provide. Needs to be selection of suppliers in Morocco. So it's easier for them to find. Now inside this building. They need a working bench. To fit the equipment for two persons to sit. You have the lighting engineer. And you have the sound engineer. So you need two staffs inside here. And each of them. They have a console. Equipment. That they work on. And this is the size of the equipment. So the width. The depth. And the height of the console. With the weight. So you see that. It has to be. I mean 17 kilos is not that heavy anyway. And the light system. They just give you one size. 525. So I guess it's a square. 525 by 525. And 60 mm height. With the weight of 7 kg. They need drawers. Below the top table. Because I guess they have to fit other small equipments below. Inside here they need a DV board. So a distribution board. This is roughly the size. So this has to be wall mounted. At roughly a high level. High. Yeah. High level. So it's easier to manipulate. Switch on and off the switches. And next to it. You need a column for cabling. So make sure you integrate that. Lighting. They need LED on dimmer. So during the show. They will turn down the dimmer. So there's not too much light coming from the cabin. As opposed to what is on the scene. Okay. And they need an aircon that is wall mounted. Now if you have an aircon. You need to provide a place for the cassette. So the cassette can easily be mounted somewhere on the side. Where it's not going to be too visible. Or you have to provide maybe some plants in front of it. Or maybe if you are having a roof. It could be also mounted on the roof. You have to decide on that. Now the schedule. What we did some research. I know you've been speaking to Faye. Faye had done a little research among our juniors. And what we decided. Is in order for the junior not to work too much. Until version 1.1. And then I review the version 1.1. And I have a lot of comments. It's easier if I give more days. Towards the version 1.1. And I review the concept board before. So you can send me your concept board on the second. I will tell you if you're on the right direction. It's quite straightforward. And then you will give me your version 1.1. On the 6th of July. I will review it on the 7th. And I will wait for your version. That goes to client on the 12th. Okay. They are quite in a rush. So I think they will answer quite fast. Although Clemet is an operator with a lot of layers. So I guess it will go to the architecture department in Paris. But it will also go to the resorts in Marrakech. They will combine their feedback before it goes to you. Now this kind of clients. They don't always go to round 2. Sometimes they choose the winner right after round 1. If they are very happy with what has been delivered by one of the juniors. So I highly recommend that you treat your project. Even if it's version 1. Very good. If you want to have a chance to get the project. Okay. You will decide to choose the winner after first round. On the first round. You don't need to give. You will have to give sizes obviously. At least width, depth and height of the building. The minimum explanation on that. You will have to give of course inside. To see how the equipment sits. Where is the desk. Towards the. Looking towards the stage. How are the windows. How are the doors to the golf area. So you will have to obviously show all that. And show a 3D. I won't send a presentation. With 3Ds that are not rendered. Okay. Because these are professional clients. And they are extremely needy. I mean it's not only needy. It's the one professional. Professional presentations. Monday.com I know you are familiar with it. So I'm not going to talk to you about it. For the others. If you have any questions on monday.com. You can always send an email. To either Faye or myself. Faye has been sending you a few emails. For this presentation. So you can just answer that email. But it's quite straightforward. Okay so for the presentation. Your presentation needs to strictly follow. The order of the following slide. And this I'm telling you. Because it's easier for the client. To refer to if all of you. Present the same way. Also something that I didn't put. Into this presentation. But it's good if you put number on your pages. So when the client calls me. Which happens all the time. They will tell me. Hey please look at Armand's page 3. What do you think he meant by blah blah blah. So and by the way. Try to put explanations that are clear. So I don't have to deal with the client. So much after. Compress your file. Because they send files. Between each of the department there. It will go to the GM of the hotel. It will go to the engineer of the hotel. It will go to the architecture. And design department. So sometimes they don't go through the monday.com board. They send each other's file. So don't send anything that is over 10 megabytes. Okay. The smaller the better. Now with this kind. Of website. You can reduce your file keeping very good quality. So it's not a problem. And as I said earlier. It is compulsory to render perspective. Oh big fault here. On at least version 1.2 and 2.2. Which are the version that goes to the client. Okay. The one that goes to me for review. It's okay. I can understand what you mean. So if you explain me what material you want for what. I don't need it rendered. But it needs to be clear enough. For me to give you as much comment and feedback as possible. The more detail I have. The more I can give you. Something which is very important in this project. Because it's only a 3x3 building. Right. I need sizes. I need to understand the sizes. So don't give me a layout without sizes. Because I can't review layouts without sizes. That's impossible. Okay. So for the presentation. Put a title page. Presentation look and feel is really up to you. It has to match whatever design. The information I need on the pages. The title of the project. Your name. The submission number. And the date of the submission. Okay. That's your title page. Then I will need a general layout. So you can do a zoom over the small areas. I mean the 3x3 building. And how you're going to lay it inside. And you can show also a wider zoom. On AutoCAD or even SketchUp. If you put a certain surrounding around. For example this cabin. Okay. So for example it should be here. Facing the stage. And the back is towards the golf area. Something like that. Then you're going to have to give a concept board. And explain your concept board. I'm following Riyadh architecture. Or I'm breaking away from Riyadh architecture. For this and this reason. But you have to be clear. And explain why you are doing what you are doing. Okay. Including colors and material. Because it's such a small area. With so little to do. It's good to have your materials. Also selection. They say that for the frames. They would like to use the same kind of color. As the rest of the building. Which is a kind of olive tree color. You can see it quite well on the picture. And the color of the building. To follow the color of their building. Now I'm waiting for them. To give me the exact reference for that. But meanwhile you can start. Because it's just color adjustment anyway. So it's not a problem. Okay. Then you need to show the perspective. And show a layout. Showing the angle where the perspective is taken from. And put the perspective. Within a context. So draw whatever is in the surrounding. At least the basic. Where is the stage. I should see a picture. Of the cabinet itself. And the stage. So I understand how both are related. Okay. And I'm showing that I'm not obstructing any view. Not obstructing any passageway. Or walkway. For the clients. To walk around. You can show obviously different views. At least back and front. So I can see the openings. Whatever makes it interesting for you. Four sides would be better. You can also show two views. And elevation. If it's easier for you. It's fine. Elevation doesn't have to be rendered obviously. But the more detailed it is. The better it is. If you have any comments. Let's say this is a light to keep the plate hot. You can always put arrow with explanation. If needed. Okay. Show whatever. How many perspectives you want. This is just informative. You just put the number of perspectives that you want. That you feel are relevant. And if you are the lucky winner. On phase 3. So it will be either 2 or 3. Depending on when the client takes the decision. Of who's the winner. You will have to do the detail of layout and elevation. Implementation. Proper sizes. Indication of how the finishing. What finishes goes where. This is just a small example. I will give you templates for that. To make sure that you don't forget anything. And then you will have to put your purchasing list. So let's say you're buying a tile. For the flooring. You will have to give the description of the tile. Where it's going. The quantities. So 9 square meters. Because it's a 3 by 3. And the link to the supplier. So any furniture or finishes you're putting. The chairs. The desk if it's not built. But I guess for you it's going to be custom built. If it is custom built. You will have to give a small detail of it. To explain the carpenter. What he should draw. The finishes. The sizes and everything. So it's a very small project. It's quite straightforward. Do you have any questions? No. Straightforward. It should be a piece of cake. Honestly. I'm expecting a very high quality on those. Because it's really easy. Okay. Yeah. So let me know meanwhile. If you have any questions in between. Don't hesitate to send me a note in your comment box. I will put. As soon as I have any other information from the client. If I do have the Pantone reference color. I will send them to you. But I think if you base on the color. On the pictures itself. Of the environment. Like here. You can see. Pretty much the color. That they are going towards. Okay. Clear? Crystal clear? Yes. Great. Thank you so much.
